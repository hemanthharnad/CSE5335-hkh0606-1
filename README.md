a. What server framework did you choose and why?

I have used Nodejs as my server framework. Node.js is especially suited for applications where you'd like to maintain a persistent 
connection from the browser back to the server. Also, I have used nodejs in the past.

b. What client framework did you choose and why?

I have used jQuery as my client framework. I have worked with jQuery before. Jquery promotes simplicity. 
It works anywhere. HTML5 is cross-browser compatible-it will work on any browser, mobile phone or tablet, and even on Apple devices.

c. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?

Implementing nodejs server was easy for me because I have implemented the same in my project before.

d. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

Handling the Json data was difficult for me. I was not aware of how to use it with ajax function.

e. What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install,
if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?

I have installed Webstorm IDE for the editor. Apart from this, no other installations were made for this project.

f. What Ubuntu commands are required to deploy and run your server?

To run the sever -

node hello_http.js
